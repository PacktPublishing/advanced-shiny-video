## About the Video Course
Shiny combines the computational power of R with the interactivity of the modern web. Along with hosting standalone apps on a webpage or embedding them in R Markdown, you can also extend your Shiny apps with CSS themes, htmlwidgets, and JavaScript actions.

At first, we begin by covering new Shiny functions, allowing you to save and restore the state of a Shiny application. Here you will learn to create a fully-featured application by exploring and analyzing the data with the use of an example. Moving on, this application will be used to demonstrate their use and function. Bookmarking and reading URLs, reading client information from browsers as well as passwords, and the use of functions and modules will all be added to the application. Next, you will learn about using JavaScript within Shiny applications. From a simple script to improve the appearance of an application to a more advanced application. An interactive map will be added using the htmlwidgets package as well as using shinyjs to perform common JavaScript tasks without writing any JavaScript also learning graphic using the Google Charts API.

Finally, you will learn the tips and tricks to share your applications. There are several ways to share Shiny applications: Gist, .zip, GitHub, and Shiny Server (cloud- and self-hosted), some of which require more work on your users’ part and some on your part. Get to explore the different methods with its advantages and disadvantages. By the end of this course, you will have all the information you will need on Shiny’s advanced techniques.
